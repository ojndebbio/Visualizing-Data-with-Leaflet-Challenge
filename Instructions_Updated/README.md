# Visualizing-Data-with-Leaflet-Challenge

In this project, a summary of all earthquakes in the last week (7 days) was plotted using leaflet. An API feed provided by USGS (United States Geological Survey) was used in getting the GeoJSON feed page for the analysis.

## Technology used in this web visualization is as follows:
* GeoJSON
* Leaflet.js
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JavaScript
* D3

### Data Used:
* https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
